# Signal Simulator Calculator

## Overview

This is a simple Coordinates Calculator for the Signal Simulator game.

The initial code is reused from https://github.com/DCay/Signal-Simulator-Coordinates-Calculator

## Tutorial

When you capture a signal and your coordinates system starts generating random coordinates, you should monitor (watch)
the coordinates and record:

* **Antenna Detection** on the main info monitor
* The **lowest azimuth** you've seen
* The **highest azimuth** you've seen
* The **lowest elevation** you've seen
* The **highest elevation** you've seen

You should **keep watching** the monitor **until you reach a point** at which you **hardly get any** values - **lower**
than your **lowest** or **higher** than your **highest**.

Input your recorded values as follows:
* **Lowest recorded azimuth** - Minimum Azimuth
* **Highest recorded azimuth** - Maximum Azimuth
* **Lowest recorded elevation** - Minimum Elevation
* **Highest recorded elevation** - Maximum Elevation

The coordinates will then be calculated based on the min, max and antenna detection coordinates.
With this calculation you can use only **MIN** or **MAX** of Azimuth or Elevation.

If you've done **everything correctly** you should receive an output below with values which should be **completely
accurate**.
